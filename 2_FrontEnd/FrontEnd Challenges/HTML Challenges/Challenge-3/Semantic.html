                <h2>what is Dogecoin</h2>
                <p>An open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by <em>Shiba Inus</em> worldwide.</p>
                <p>At its heart, Dogecoin is the accidental crypto movement that makes people smile! 
                    It is also an opensource peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilizes blockchain technology, 
                    a highly secure decentralized system of storing information as a public ledger that is 
                    maintained by a network of computers called nodes. More than this, though, is the ethos of 
                    Dogecoin, summarised in the <a href="https://foundation.dogecoin.com/manifesto/" target="_blank">Dogecoin Manifesto</a>, and its amazing, vibrant community made up 
                    of friendly folks just like you!</p>
