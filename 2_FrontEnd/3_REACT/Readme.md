# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. User interfaces built using react consists of `Components`. A component is a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance.

React was created to solve the problem of building large applications with data that changes over time. Re-rendering the entire dom whenever there is a small change is expensive. React solves this problem by only re-rendering the components that have changed.
