# Document Object Model

The **Document Object Model** (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. Essentially, it creates a structured representation of the HTML page that can be manipulated with programming languages such as JavaScript.

- The DOM provides a **hierarchical tree-like representation of a web page**, with each element represented as a node.

- The DOM can be manipulated using scripting languages such as JavaScript, allowing developers to dynamically update the page content, style, and structure.

- The DOM is designed to be platform- and language-independent, making it possible to use the same DOM API across different programming languages and platforms.

- The DOM provides a consistent interface for accessing and manipulating elements on a web page, regardless of how the page was created or how it is displayed.

- The DOM includes a range of methods and properties that allow developers to perform a wide range of tasks, such as adding and removing elements, modifying text and attributes, and responding to user events.

- The **DOM is updated in real-time** as the page is modified, which means that changes made to the DOM are immediately reflected in the web page.
