#### `Web development` refers to the process of creating and maintaining *websites* and *web applications* that are accessible over the internet. 

> #### This repository contains all the code, notes, and resources I have written while learning Full stack web development. I would be updating this repository as I learn new topics. Minor projects would be added in this repository itself. Major projects would be added to separate repositories and linked [here](./Extras/Projects.md).
