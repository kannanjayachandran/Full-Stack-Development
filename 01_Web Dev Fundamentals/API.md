# API ~ Application Programming Interface üß©

</div>

An API is simply a way in which two programs are able to communicate with each other. There are many types of API's. Whenever we want to talk with the server we use an API. There are many types of API's. Some of them are;

## Web API üåê

A web API is a way in which two programs are able to communicate with each other over the internet. The two programs are usually a client and a server.

### RESTful API's 

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a set of rules that are used to create API's. It is basically an architecture to create API's. With REST we would be working with resources. At the core REST is based on what we call `Architectural Constraints`. These are the rules that we need to follow to create a RESTful API. They are;

- Client-Server : Must follow client-server model.

- Stateless : The server must not store any information about the client.

- Cacheable : The server must be able to cache the responses (Not every end-point must be cacheable but every end-point must define whether they are cacheable or not).

- Layered System : The server must be able to communicate with other servers.

- Uniform Interface : The server must have a uniform interface.

- Code on Demand : The server must be able to send code to the client (This is optional).

### RPC API's

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. The core idea of RPC API's are API endpoints represent actions or functions.
[REST is based on the idea of resources and RPC is based on the idea of actions/procedures.]

### SOAP API's

SOAP stands for Simple Object Access protocol. It uses `XML` to transfer data. It can get very verbose and complex, hence soap is not used for frontend to backend communication. It is used for backend to backend communication.

### GraphQL API's

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It would only return the essential data that is needed.
