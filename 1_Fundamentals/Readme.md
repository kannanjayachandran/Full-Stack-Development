# Web Development

Most software products use the internet in some way, often reaching users through websites, web applications, or mobile apps. In this section, we'll explore the basics of how the internet works and how web applications are created.

Web development involves designing, building, and launching interactive and visually appealing websites and applications. It can range from creating a simple static page to developing complex web-based applications, online businesses, and social networks.

We'll start by understanding what the internet is and how it functions. Next, we'll cover the HTTP protocol, the backbone of web communication, followed by an introduction to APIs, which are essential for modern web applications. Weâ€™ll also touch on web security, how browsers work, and how content is rendered on the web.
